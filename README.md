# EPISummary
My handwritten summary of II.Problems (except for the parallelization part) and the Honors Class of the book "Elements of Programming Interviews, C++ Edition" 

I have also added some additional topics to the summary, such as segment trees, range minimum queries, and union find.

Use the PDFs! I once started, but never finished the LaTeX version.

(The Honors Class summary file will be updated once I get access to a large scanner again...)
